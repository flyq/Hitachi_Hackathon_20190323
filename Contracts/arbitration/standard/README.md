# Standard

Proposal of standards to be used beyond the Kleros project to allow interoperability between other dapps.

Feel free to contribute by making pull request and reporting potential issue smart contract developers may have while using those standards.

We also encourage you to create contracts implementing those standards, specially arbitrable ones.
